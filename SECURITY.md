# Reporting Security Issues and Vulnerabilites

The Code4Recovery team and community takes security bugs in our products seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the [Security Tab](https://github.com/code4recovery/12-step-meeting-list/security), located under the repository name. If you cannot see the "Security" tab, select the ... dropdown menu, and then click Security. Please include as much information as possible, including steps to help our team recreate the issue.

The Code4Recovery team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

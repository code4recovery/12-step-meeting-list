        This **Bug Report form is for the TSML developer team only**.

        👉 If you are an **end-user** (WordPress site owner, meeting list admin, etc.) and need help,  
        please do **not** open an issue. Instead, go to **[Discussions → Q&A](https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/discussions/categories/q-a)**.  
        
        Issues opened here that are not by maintainers will be **closed without response**.  
        Thank you for helping us keep GitHub Issues focused on development work.

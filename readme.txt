This plugin helps twelve step recovery programs list their meetings. It standardizes addresses, and displays results in a searchable list and map.

== Description ==

This plugin helps twelve step recovery programs list their meetings. It standardizes addresses, and displays results in a searchable list and map.

It's also the easiest way for Alcoholics Anonymous service entities to get listed in the [Meeting Guide mobile app](https://www.aa.org/meeting-guide-app/) for iOS and Android devices.

This plugin was originally designed to maintain a list of A.A. meetings in Santa Clara County, CA. It is now used to provide meeting information for A.A. and other 12-step recovery groups around the world.

= Notes =

* The Meeting Notes field is for any non-standardized meeting info, such as Basement, or Building C
* Location should be a simple place-name, eg Queen of the Valley Hospital
* Address should only be the address; no "Upstairs" or "Building C" or "Near 2nd Ave"
* You can fill in a very basic address and then when you tab away from that field you will see it try to standardize the address for you. If you write "1000 trancas, napa" it will replace it with "1000 Trancas St, Napa, CA 94558, USA."

== Installation ==

Just install the plugin, add a mapping API key from Mapbox (or Google), and start entering your meetings. That is all it takes to get started!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My meeting type isn't listed! =
If it's a broadly-applicable meeting type, please ask us in the [discussions forum](https://github.com/code4recovery/12-step-meeting-list/discussions). We must maintain consistency for the [mobile apps](https://www.aa.org/meeting-guide-app/), so not all proposals are accepted.

If you have access to your theme's functions.php, you may add additional meeting types or rename existing ones. Simply adapt the following example to your purposes:

	if (function_exists('tsml_custom_types')) {
		tsml_custom_types(array(
			'XYZ' => 'My Custom Type',
		));
	}

Please note a few things about custom types:

1. Once you've added the type, you will see it under 'More' on the Meeting edit screen. It will show up in the dropdown once you use it on a meeting.
1. Be careful with the codes ("XYZ" in the above example) as this gives you the ability to replace existing types.
1. Note that custom meeting types are not imported into the Meeting Guide app.
1. They are for members in recovery to find a meeting. If you can't imagine an addict looking for a meeting this way, then we recommend not adding it to your site.
1. Don't add a type for the default, eg 'Non-Smoking.' If you do that, then you have to be vigilant about tagging every last meeting in order to make the data complete.

= Where are my meetings listed? =
It depends on your Permalinks setup. The easiest way to find the link is to go to the **Dashboard > Meetings > Import & Export** page and look for it under "Where's My Info?"

= I need to correct a meeting address or change a pin's location =
We get our geocoding positions from Google (this true even if your maps are by Mapbox). Google is correct an amazing amount of the time, but not always. If you need to add a custom location, add this to your theme's functions.php.

Note you can add multiple entries to the array below.

	if (function_exists('tsml_custom_addresses')) {
		tsml_custom_addresses(array(
			'5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France' => array(
				'formatted_address' => '5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France',
				'city' => 'Paris',
				'latitude' => 48.858372,
				'longitude' => 2.294481,
				'approximate' => 'no',
			),
		));
	}

= Can I update the type descriptions? = 

Yes, you can add, update, or remove these descriptions. Adapt this example as needed and add it to your theme's functions.php. Using an empty string `''` will unset the type.

	if (function_exists('tsml_custom_descriptions')) {
		tsml_custom_descriptions([
			'C' => 'Special closed type description',
			'O' => '', //this type has been removed
		]);
	}

= What is Change Detection? =
Change Detection augments our data import utility by periodically polling your data sources and generating email notifications to Change Notification Email recipients who you registered on the Settings page.

= How can I enable Change Detection for my disabled data source? =
Change Detection can only be enabled when adding a data source to your list of Data Sources. Re-registering an existing data source is necessary to get Change Detection enabled. This includes:
* To be safe, always make a backup of your existing meeting list by using the link on the Import tab to export your Meeting List.
* If you are going to have change detection on multple data sources, you may choose to add the parent organization(s) to your list of Regions first (i.e. District 1, YourCity Intergroup, etc.).
* Remove the data source (click on the X next to its Last Refresh timestamp) We suggest first noting the json feed URL (hover over the feed name to view the URL) for use when adding it back.
* Set data source options: enter a name for your feed, set the feed URL, select the parent region from the Parent Region dropdown, and lastly choose the "Change Detection Enabled" option.
* Pressing the "Add Data Source" button will register a WordPress Cron Job (tsml_scan_data_source) for the newly added and enabled data source. By default, this cron job is scheduled to run "Once Daily" starting at midnight (12:00 AM).
The frequency and time that the cron job runs is optionally configurable with the [WP Crontrol[(https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crontrol/)] plugin.

= How can I convert a data source into a maintainable list for my new website? =
When editing a data source record a warning is given that the record will be over-written when the data source is refreshed.
To avoid this warning and prevent a refresh from altering an edited record it's necessary to follow a few simple steps to reimport the data source records:

* Make a backup of your existing meeting list by using the export link found on the Import tab of the Import & Export page.
* Open the exported file (meetings.csv) which you should find in your local Downloads folder.
* Delete the entire 'Data Source' column found near the far right and then Save the file (recommend using Save As to rename the file to something unique such as my-meetings.csv).
* Remove the imported data source (click on the X next to its Last Refresh timestamp).
* Import the saved file using the Import CSV feature on the Import & Export page.

Your meeting list records will now no longer display a warning message when being edited, and will not be overwritten by a data source refresh operation!

= How can I make the Region dropdown not be collapsible? =
Add this CSS to your theme:

	div#tsml #meetings .controls ul.dropdown-menu div.expand { display: none; }
	div#tsml #meetings .controls ul.dropdown-menu ul.children { height: auto; }

= How can I show Any Day by default? =
The easiest way is to link to that view straight from your navigation. Usually that looks like `/meetings/?tsml-day=any`, but it can vary depending on your settings.

If you'd prefer to keep the default address, you could add this code to your theme's functions.php instead:

	$tsml_defaults['day'] = null;

= How do I change the default search radius for location searches? =
Add this to your theme's functions.php. The value should be an existing value, ie 1, 5, 10, 25 or 50.

	$tsml_defaults['distance'] = 25;

= Can I get the meeting list to display the full address, including city, state and country? =
Add this to your theme's functions.php.

	$tsml_street_only = false;

= Can I set a custom "Update Meeting Info" button in TSML UI? =
Add a URL to your theme's functions.php.

	$tsml_feedback_url = '/feedback';

You can add variables to the URL that can be picked up by a form plugin:

	$tsml_feedback_url = '/feedback?slug={{slug}}&id={{id}}&name={{name}}&day={{day}}&time={{time}}&end_time={{end_time}}&types={{types}}&notes={{notes}}&conference_url={{conference_url}}&conference_url_notes={{conference_url_notes}}&conference_phone={{conference_phone}}&conference_phone_notes={{conference_phone_notes}}&location={{location}}&formatted_address={{formatted_address}}&region={{region}}&location_notes={{location_notes}}&group={{group}}&group_notes={{group_notes}}&district={{district}}&website={{website}}&email={{email}}&phone={{phone}}&venmo={{venmo}}&square={{square}}&paypal={{paypal}}&data_source_name={{data_source_name}}';

Feel free to adjust as necessary. This can also be a new email URL, such as:

	$tsml_feedback_url = "mailto:office@domain.com?subject={{slug}}";

= Can I change the order of the columns on the meeting list page, eg put the Region first? =
Add this to your theme's functions.php. Feel free to change the order or column names (eg 'Region') but keep the keys the same (eg 'region').

	$tsml_columns = array(
		'region' => 'Region',
		'time' => 'Time',
		'distance' => 'Distance',
		'name' => 'Name',
		'location_group' => 'Location / Group',
		'address' => 'Address',
		'types' => 'Types'
	);

= Can I change the "Location / Group" column to display only the Location name instead?
Add this to your theme's functions.php.

	$tsml_columns = array(
		'region' => 'Region',
		'time' => 'Time',
		'distance' => 'Distance',
		'name' => 'Name',
		'location' => 'Location',
		'address' => 'Address',
		'types' => 'Types'
	);

= Can I change the default sort order on the meeting list page? =
By default, the plugin sorts by day, then time, then location name. To set your own sort index, add this to your functions.php:

	$tsml_sort_by = 'region'; //options are name, location, address, time, or region

= If I am using Mapbox can I change the theme? =
By default this plugin uses the Streets theme, v9. To change this, add this to your functions.php:

	$tsml_mapbox_theme = '<theme URL>'

*Please note* the version of the Mapbox script we use doesn't support all the themes displayed on the Mapbox site. The themes which have been tested and are known to work are: mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v9, mapbox://styles/mapbox/outdoors-v9, mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v9, mapbox://styles/mapbox/dark-v9, mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-v9, and mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-streets-v9.

= How can I override the meeting list or detail pages? =
If you are using the "Legacy UI" appearance, copy the files from the plugin's templates directory into your theme's root directory. If you're using a theme from the Theme Directory, you may be better off creating a [Child Theme](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes). Now, you may override those pages. The archive-meetings.php file controls the meeting list page, single-meetings.php controls the meetings detail, and single-locations.php controls the location detail.

If you are using TSML UI, then adding local CSS is the best way to customize the appearance of the meeting finder.

*Please note* these pages will evolve over time. If you override, you will someday experience website errors after an update. If that happens, please update your theme's copy of the plugin pages.

= Can I see types in the meeting list? And can I adjust the /Men and /Women after the meeting name? =
To see types in the meeting list, one way to do it is to add some CSS to your theme which will make a types column visible.

	@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
		div#tsml #meetings .types { display: table-cell !important; }
	}

One drawback of this approach is that it shows all the meeting types, and you might not want all of them to be displayed over and over in the meeting list.

Another approach is to adjust which meeting types are "flagged" in the meeting names, by default for most programs this is /Men and /Women. To adjust this, find the meeting type code for each type you want to show and include it in your theme's functions.php like this:

	if (function_exists('tsml_custom_flags')) {
		tsml_custom_flags(array('M', 'W', 'O', 'C'));
	}

The code above will add "Open" and "Closed" flags to the meeting name.

= Can I import a custom spreadsheet format? =
If you don't mind some PHP programming, then yes! Create a function called `tsml_import_reformat`, and use it to
reformat your incoming data to the standard format

	if (!function_exists('tsml_import_reformat')) {
		function tsml_import_reformat($meetings) {
			//your code goes here
			return $meetings;
		}
	}

= How can I change some of the text on the template pages, eg the column headings? =
You can make use of the [gettext filter](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/gettext) to override the plugin's translation strings. For example, if you wanted to replace 'Region' with 'City,' you could add the following to your functions.php file.

	function theme_override_tsml_strings($translated_text, $text, $domain) {
		if ($domain == '12-step-meeting-list') {
			switch ($translated_text) {
				case 'Region':
					return 'City';
			}
		}
		return $translated_text;
	}
	add_filter('gettext', 'theme_override_tsml_strings', 20, 3);

= How can I temporarily hide a meeting without deleting it? =
Save it as a draft by editing the meeting's Status.

= Are there shortcodes? =
Yes, you can use `[tsml_meeting_count]`, `[tsml_location_count]`, `[tsml_group_count]`, and `[tsml_region_count]` to display human-formatted counts of your entities. For example, "Our area currently comprises [tsml_meeting_count] meetings." 

`[tsml_next_meetings count="5"]` displays a small table with the next several meetings in it. Use the `count` parameter to adjust how many are displayed. This will be unstyled if you're not using bootstrap in your theme.

Use `[tsml_types_list]` and `[tsml_regions_list]` to output linked lists to your meeting finder.

Use `[tsml_ui]` to display the TSML UI meeting finder.

= Are there translations to other languages? =
It is translated into Polish. If you would like to volunteer to help translate another language, we would be pleased to work with you.

= I entered contact information into the meeting edit page but don't see it displayed on the site. =
That's right, we don't display that information by default for the sake of anonymity. To display it in your theme, go to Meetings > Settings and set the Meeting/Group Contacts dropdown to "public."

= Can I run this as my main website homepage? =
Sure. Try adding this code to your theme's functions.php:

	add_action('pre_get_posts', 'tsml_front_page');

Also check out our [One Page Meeting List](https://github.com/code4recovery/one-page-meeting-list) theme.

= Can I use this plugin to list telephone meetings or other meetings without a fixed location? =
Yes, but you will need to enter an approximate location. To do this simply enter the city and state or province of the general geographic location of the meeting into the address field.

= Can I change the URL of the meetings list? =
Yes, try setting the $tsml_slug variable in your functions.php.

	$tsml_slug = 'schedule';

You may set it to false to hide the public meeting finder altogether.

To apply these changes, you must go to Settings > Permalinks and click "Save Changes"

= Can I update the $tsml_slug to be appended after the site url instead of the blog url identified in permalinks structure
Yes, you can use the following filter to change the with_front configuration from true to false

	add_filter( 'tsml_meeting_with_front', '__return_false');

= Can I use my own geocoding API key?
Yes, add the following to your theme's functions.php. Make sure you've enabled the Geocoding API in the Google Cloud Console.

	$tsml_google_geocoding_key = 'my.api.key.goes.here';

= How can I report security bugs?

To report a security issue, please use the [Security Tab](https://github.com/code4recovery/12-step-meeting-list/security) on our GitHub repo, 
located under the repository name. If you cannot see the "Security" tab, select the ... dropdown menu, and then click Security. 
Please include as much information as possible, including steps to help our team recreate the issue.

= Can I include custom fields in the CSV export?

Yes, you will need to know the key name of the field. Then include an array in your theme's function.php file:

	$tsml_custom_meeting_fields = [
		'my_custom_field_key' => 'My Custom Field',
	];
